Brief:
A link count shows how many directory entries link to the file. There are two types of links which are symbolic link and
hard link. Hard link refers to specific location of physical data. Symbolic link refers to a symbolic path indicating the
absract location of another file. We can see the link count in the second column of ls -ali command. This count number tells 
the total number of links a file has. This count, however does not include the soft-link count.
The soft-link is not part of the link count since the soft-link's inode number is different from the original file but the
hard link does. 
In our case '.' refer to the current directory and '..' refers to the parent directory. The link count of the 'vdb1' directory
is 4 which we can see it in the row that contains '.'. This is because vdb1 directory contains another directory in it which
is 'work' directory and when we create a directory in a directory, it adds 2 to the link count. Also, the reason that 'work' directory
has a link count of 2 is because it does not contain any hard link, apart from the hard link to its parent which is '..', or a directory 
but a soft link in it. Since the soft link does notincrement the link count, it stays 2 as it is created.
For the file pw, it contains a soft link which has nothing to do with the link count and because of this the link count of pw is 1.
